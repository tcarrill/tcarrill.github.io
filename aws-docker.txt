Build, tag, and push Docker image
Now that your repository exists, you can push a Docker image by following these steps:
Successfully created repository
https://617407650645.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/oovee-web
Prerequisites: If you haven't installed the AWS CLI, please follow the instructions here to do so. If you haven't installed Docker, please follow the instructions here to do so.
1) Retrieve the docker login command that you can use to authenticate your Docker client to your registry:
aws ecr get-login --region us-east-1

2) Run the docker login command that was returned in the previous step.
3) Build your Docker image using the following command. For information on building a Docker file from scratch see the instructions here. You can skip this step if your image is already built:
docker build -t oovee-web .

4) After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:
docker tag oovee-web:latest 617407650645.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/oovee-web:latest

5) Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:
docker push 617407650645.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/oovee-web:latest
