This will be a series of short articles with the intent to build a functioning Z80 virtual machine.  This first part will act as an introduction to both the Z80 and virtual machines in general.

## Z80 Introduction
First, a very quick history lesson, then on to the interesting bits (no pun).  The Z80 is an 8-bit microprocessor available since 1976 (yes, I said since 1976, it is still in production).  The Z80 was a popular processor for use in arcade and video game consoles of the 70s and 80s and, along with the MOS Technology 6502, powered much of the early home computer market.

## Z80 Register Set and Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
Now for the good stuff, the technical stuff.  As a (low level) programmer, our view of a machine is defined by a few things, the registers available to us, the memory available to us and the instructions we use to tie it all together and tell the machine what to do.
