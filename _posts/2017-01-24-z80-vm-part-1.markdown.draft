This will be a series of short articles with the intent to build a functioning z80 VM.  We will start out small, implementing only a few of the registers and opcodes which operate on them.  Calling this a VM may be a bit of a misnomer, we will be reproducing just the processor and its whopping 64K of addressable memory in software.  We will not (to start) be building any other hardware (hard disk, I/O systems).  It is more akin to the Java VM in that regard, our little software Z80 should be able to run any Z80 assembled binary.
